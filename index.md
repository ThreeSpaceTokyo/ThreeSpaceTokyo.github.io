Welcome to **Three Space Tokyo**, a space for creating and connecting. Our goal is to bring together international artists and designers in Tokyo and connect them with the Japanese community. Beyond serving as the studio for our founding members, it is also a workspace for resident artists and a venue for events and exhibitions. Three Space Tokyo was founded by design artist [**Ying Chang**](https://www.yingchang.co.uk/), fine art painter [**Aya Ogasawara**](https://www.ayaogas.com/), and computational cosmologist [**Jia Liu**](https://liuxx479.github.io/). We are currently searching for a physical location and plan to open in spring 2025. Please contact us if you are interested in collaborating: **threespacetokyo@gmail.com**.
